# Automatic-water-level-sensor-and-controller-system
In this Project , we investigate the design of a water level sensor device that is able to detect and control the level of water in a certain water tank or a similar water storage system. The system firstly senses the amount of water available in the tank by the level detector part and then adjusts the state of the water pump in accordance to the water level information. This electronic design achieves automation through sequential logic implemented using a flip flop. A seven segment display and a relay-based motor pump driving circuit are part of this integrated design. The water pump automatically turns on and starts filling the tank when the water level is empty or level ONE and turned-off and stop filling the tank when water level reaches maximum-level NINE; furthermore, the water pump will remain in its standstill state from level EIGHT down to TWO when the level is decreasing due to water consumption.
